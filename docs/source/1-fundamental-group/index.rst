One key attraction of HoTT (homotopy type theory)
is for doing homotopy theory.
In this arc we will formalize what it means for the circle
``S¹`` to have fundamental group ``ℤ`` in this setting.

Applying the philosophy of :ref:`trinitarianism`,
is strongly recommended in this arc.
However, it is designed so that anyone eager to see familiar
geometric results can also start here
with no prerequisites.
Hence, this arc mostly adopts a geometric (hence categorical)
perspective on types.
