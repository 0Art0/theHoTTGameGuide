Quest 3 - Side Quests
=====================

Under construction


.. _intEqNatSumNat:

``ℤ ≡ ℕ ⊔ ℕ``
-------------

In this side quest we show that ``ℤ`` is equal to ``ℕ ⊔ ℕ`` as spaces.
Try imitating things we have done in the previous quests and come
up with a proof yourself.

As in defining ``doubleCover`` in :ref:`quest 0 <quest0WorkingWithTheCircle>`
we first make an isomorphism and then convert it to a path/proof of equality.
To make the isomorphism note that
the definition of ``ℤ`` is already as "two copies of ``ℕ``",
just laid out a bit differently.

If you have made the function and inverse
in the isomorphisms appropriately,
you should only need constant paths in the
proofs that they satisfy ``section`` and ``retract``
respectively.
